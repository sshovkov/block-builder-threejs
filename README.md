# Three.js Block Builder

This simple simulation of interactive building blocks was designed and implemented using Three.js as an interface to WEBGL. 

The user is able to add building blocks to the grid by using the cursor. A transparent block shows the user where the block would go and on click, a randomly-colored building block will be placed on the grid. The user is able to build horizontally and vertically, remove building blocks, and orbit around the focal object.

Official [Three.js](https://threejs.org) documentation was used as a reference.
